# KVM Switch Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document provides detailed information about hardware KVM (Keyboard, Video, Mouse) switch options for a home lab setup, allowing you to control multiple computers with a single keyboard and mouse while maintaining separate video connections.

## Benefits of Hardware KVM Solutions

- **Seamless Control**: Switch between multiple computers with simple hotkey combinations

   - Connect each computer to the KVM using the provided USB cables
   - For KVMs with video support, connect the video cables accordingly

2. **Hotkey Configuration**:
   - Most KVMs use Scroll Lock or Ctrl+Alt as the trigger key
   - For example, pressing Ctrl+Alt+1 switches to computer 1
   - Consult your specific KVM's manual for custom hotkey programming

3. **Additional Features Setup**:
   - Audio switching (if supported)
   - USB peripheral sharing (if supported)
   - Custom hotkey programming (if supported)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Keyboard Not Recognized
- Ensure the keyboard is connected to the correct port (usually labeled with a keyboard icon)
- Try a different USB port on the KVM
- Some gaming keyboards may require direct connection to the computer

### Switching Delay
- Some KVMs have a built-in delay to prevent accidental switching
- Check the manual for settings to adjust this delay

### USB Device Not Working
- Ensure the device is compatible with the KVM's USB version
- Some specialized devices may require direct connection to the computer

## Conclusion

A hardware KVM switch is an excellent investment for your home lab setup, providing reliable and secure control over multiple computers without the overhead of software solutions. Based on your current setup with separate monitors for each device, an input-only KVM like the ATEN CS64U or IOGear GCS24U would be the most cost-effective solution.
