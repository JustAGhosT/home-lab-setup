## Core Data Models

### LintIssue Model

- Key attributes:
  - line_number: Location of issue in file
  - issue_code: Unique identifier for rule violation type
  - severity: Enum (ERROR, WARNING, STYLE)
  - message: Human readable description
  - fix_function: Optional automatic correction logic
- Importance Score: 95

### FileReport Model
- Aggregates lint issues for a single markdown file
- Tracks:
  - File path and content
  - Collection of LintIssue instances
  - Status of fixable vs non-fixable issues
  - Issue counts by severity level
- Importance Score: 85

### ValidationRule Registry
- Defines available markdown validation rules
- Rule definitions include:
  - Rule ID (e.g. MD001, MD002)
  - Severity level
  - Fix availability flag
  - Custom validation logic
- Importance Score: 80

## Schema Relationships

### Issue -> FileReport
- Many-to-one relationship
- Each issue belongs to one file report
- File reports contain multiple issues

### Rule -> Issue
- One-to-many relationship 
- Each rule can generate multiple issues
- Issues reference their originating rule
