# api-endpoints

Based on the provided specification, there are no direct API endpoint implementations or documentation available in the codebase. The specification primarily focuses on:

1. A markdown linting tool located in `tools/markdown_lint/`
2. PowerShell modules for HomeLab infrastructure management
3. Deployment and configuration utilities

While these components may interact with APIs internally, there are no explicit endpoint definitions, request/response formats, or authentication mechanisms documented in the provided source files.

The closest related functionality appears to be in the HomeLab.Web module, which handles website deployments, but the specification does not include details about any exposed API endpoints.
