## Cost Management

- **VPN Gateway**: ~$26.28/month (Basic SKU)
- **NAT Gateway**: ~$32.40/month + $0.045/GB data processing (+ ~$2.60/month per associated public IP)
- **Public IP addresses**: ~$4-6/month each
- **App Service Plan**: ~$15/month (B1 tier) and up
- **Static Web Apps**: Free tier available, $9/month (Standard)
- **DNS Zones**: ~$0.50/month per zone + query charges
- **Container Apps**: ~$0.000024/vCPU-second + ~$0.000004/GiB-second

By keeping the NAT Gateway disabled when not in use, you can significantly reduce costs.

For detailed cost optimization strategies, see the [Cost Optimization Strategy](docs/diagrams/cost-optimization-strategy.md) diagram.

## Configuration Settings

The HomeLab setup allows you to configure:
- Environment (dev, test, prod)

## Troubleshooting

### VPN Connection Issues

1. Verify that the client certificate is properly installed:
   - Open "certmgr.msc"
   - Check under "Personal > Certificates" for your computer certificate
   - Check under "Trusted Root Certification Authorities > Certificates" for the VPN root certificate

2. Check VPN Gateway status in Azure Portal:
   - Navigate to your VPN Gateway resource
   - Check "Overview" page for status
   - Review "Point-to-site configuration" for proper setup

3. Review connection logs:
   - On Windows, check Event Viewer under "Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > VPN"
   - Check the HomeLab log file specified in your configuration

For a detailed view of the network traffic flow, see the [Traffic Flow and Routing](docs/diagrams/traffic-flow-and-routing.md) diagram.

### NAT Gateway Issues

1. Verify subnet associations:
   - In Azure Portal, navigate to your virtual network
   - Check subnet configurations to confirm NAT Gateway association

2. Test connectivity:
   - Deploy a test VM in the subnet
   - Try to access internet resources
   - Check outbound IP using a service like ipinfo.io

### Website Deployment Issues

1. Check App Service status:
   - Verify the App Service Plan is running
   - Check Web App deployment status
   - Review deployment logs for errors

2. Troubleshoot custom domains:
   - Verify DNS records are correctly configured
   - Check domain verification status
   - Ensure SSL certificates are valid and properly bound

### DNS Management Issues

1. Verify DNS zone configuration:
   - Check name servers are correctly set at the registrar
   - Verify DNS propagation using tools like `nslookup` or online DNS checkers
   - Check for conflicting DNS records
